# Front-End Travel Website in React JS

Welcome to my Front-End Travel Website built using React JS! In this project, I am crafting a visually stunning travel website without the use of CSS frameworks. Instead, I'll be writing custom CSS for all my styling needs. I'm leveraging the power of React's functional components and passing properties down to those components for a modular and efficient design.

## Features

- **Custom Styling:** I'm writing my own CSS to create a unique and visually appealing design tailored specifically for my travel website.
  
- **Modular Components:** Utilizing functional components and props to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.
  
- **Dependencies:**
    - **React Icons:** Enhance my UI with a variety of icons for a better user experience.
    - **Smooth Scroll:** Smooth scrolling functionality for seamless navigation throughout the website.
    - **React-Responsive-Carousel:** Implement responsive carousels to showcase stunning travel destinations.
